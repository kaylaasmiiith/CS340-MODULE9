How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To create maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I consistently use clear naming conventions and adhere to structured programming practices. In the CRUD Python module (animal_shelter.py), I clearly separated functions and responsibilities, which significantly improved readability and maintainability. By modularizing database operations into reusable functions, it allowed me to quickly connect dashboard widgets to MongoDB in ProjectTwoDashboard.ipynb. This approach streamlined development and made debugging straightforward. I could reuse this CRUD module in future projects involving database interactions, potentially adapting it to other NoSQL databases or web applications.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When faced with a problem, I first break down the requirements clearly. For Grazioso Salvareâ€™s dashboard and database needs, I began by identifying essential features and created a structured design using modular coding. This methodical approach was more organized compared to previous procedural assignments. Moving forward, I will continue using modular design, iterative development, and thorough testing to efficiently create databases and applications that meet various client specifications.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, develop, and refine software solutions to address real-world challenges efficiently. The dashboard I developed for Grazioso Salvare illustrates this point by enabling swift access and management of shelter data, facilitating quicker decisions for animal rescue operations. Such projects demonstrate how effective software solutions enhance operational efficiency and help organizations like Grazioso Salvare fulfill their missions more effectively.
